            <h2>ALL ABOUT THE MAKING!</h2>
            <br />
            I (Michael Hardy) began the Cookie Critters Development in the
            Winter of 2008... The Game contains excellent Graphics, superb Sound
            Effects, Good Animations and A Great Music Loop... The Game was not
            really that hard to make however, after the first release in
            December of 2008 a few bugs and glitches had to be worked out. I now
            believe that the Game is Bug Free! I had a bad Computer Crash and
            lost all of the Source Code to Cookie Critters So now in 2025 I
            Decided to Re-Write it making the Game even better. The Last Version
            (Before the System Crash) Was 1.0 I Re-Created the Game adding new
            features, Re-Creating all Aspects of the Game such as The Level
            Editor, The Launcher and The Game Engine itself. On December 10th,
            2009 I decided to Add New Interfaces for the game, launcher and
            level editor. Their Pretty Cool. <br />
            and You are now able to change the interface! When I say Interface I
            mean the GUI (TitleBar, MessageBoxes, Etc...)<br />
            <br />
            Cookie Critters has sold a Few Copies since 2008 but I believe with
            the new changes and updates that it will sell even more... <br />
            <br />
            I have also decided to sell all rights to this game to the right
            person so if your interested then Contact Me and We can talk about
            the price, rights and etc...<br />
            <br />
            Cookie Critters Was Created Using The Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
            Software with SP6 Installed For VB. The Compiler Version Used Was
            The Professional Edition. This is included with the Source Code
            package for someone who wants to buy all rights to this game. <br />
            <br />
            The Idea for Cookie Critters Game Came From My Daughter (Zoe)
            because she loves the pacman and ms pacman style games so I
            Originally Created Cookie Critters For Her!<br />
            <br />
            Currently the game's trial comes with 40 premade levels but a Level
            Editor is included for those who want more levels. Those who buy the
            Commercial Version Can Request that We make more levels to include
            with the Full Edition for them so they won't have to create more
            levels. Using the level Editor is actually pretty easy though.<br />
            <br />
            Well that sums it up for the Development portion now go download the
            try before you buy version and see what you think of it. We are
            always looking for suggestions on the game so contact the support
