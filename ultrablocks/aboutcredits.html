            <span class="role"> Development Tools Used :</span> I Created  The Ultra-Blocks Game Completely On An Android Phone Using  The AIDE Pro. App. . After I Compiled and Built the App I then Used APK Editor Pro On Android as well as MT Manager Pro for Android To Tweak The App and To Make  Some Minor Changes. The Graphics Contained Within The App I Used PicsArt Pro and PhotoRoom Pro Two Graphic App's On Android... For the Launcher Icons I used an Online Android Launcher Icon Generator... I may release the Complete Source Code to My Ultra-Blocks  Game For Free Eventually But For Now You Must Purchase It For A Fee Of $ 1, 500.00 You can buy it from the Official Web Page!
